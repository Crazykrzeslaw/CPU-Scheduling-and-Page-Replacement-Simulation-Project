User Guide:
The program is located in the main folder. The compiled program, along with the graphical interface, is also found in the main folder (main.exe), along with input data files, namely pages_generated.txt and processes_generated.txt. The program generates reports in text files upon closing the graphical interface (and all windows opened during program operation) to the 'reports' folder. If such a folder does not exist, it indicates that no report has been generated yet.

The source files are released under an open-source license, allowing anyone to modify and use them according to their preferences
